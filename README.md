## Process prediction for email answering using robotic process automation
Please note that this repository contains files to reproduce parts of the paper on "Process prediction for email answering using robotic process automation".

###### Abstract: Today, emailing systems are one of the information systems (IS) that are increasingly used for performing business process (BP) activities. BP actors usually must compose emails when performing their repetitive activities, even though their textual contents tend to be similar. Furthermore, they have only partial access to corporate email business knowledge if they only rely on traditional search methods, which are additionally slow and time-consuming. Artificial Intelligence technologies have been used to reduce the burden of repetition and to facilitate human tasks. Robotic Process Automation (RPA) tools operate in the user interface and perform tasks in the same way that a human would. These tools would help to extract routines (i.e. repetitive tasks) previously ex- ecuted by a human from the user interface (UI) logs. In this context, this paper proposes an RPA solution to assist users in carrying out their email-based routines. Starting from email logs, we use machine learning and text analytic models to handle the non-structured nature of emails, in order to discover two types of routines: (i) Activity and data-oriented routines, and (ii) textual routines. Giving a received email, these routines are used to respectively (i) predict BP activities and data to be included in the email response, and (ii) recommend textual email response tem- plates. We evaluate our approach using the public Enron email dataset.
