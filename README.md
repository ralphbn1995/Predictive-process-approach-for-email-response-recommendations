## Predictive process approach for email response recommendations
Please note that this repository contains files to reproduce parts of the paper on "Predictive process approach for email response recommendations".

###### Abstract: Process prediction involves analyzing traces to identify future activities at a specific step within a given process. These traces can be found in the logs of information systems used by business actors during process execution, including email systems. Email traces can be used for process prediction. However, the non-structured textual nature of their content makes applying existing process prediction techniques unfeasible. Additionally, making predictions in the context of processoriented emails is not limited to identifying future business process (BP) activities, as it is mostly targeted by existing works. It requires recommending the emails that enable BP actors to perform these activities. As for existing works on email prediction, they mostly focus on enhancing email management, with limited consideration for the context of business processes. For those that combine email management with the notion of BP, they are mostly limited to the stage of BP discovery from email logs or at most classifying incoming emails into BP activities. In this paper, we present a process-activity aware email response recommendation system. We mainly focus on recommending useful BP knowledge and an email response template for its main body when responding to an incoming email. These BP knowledge are about the set of activities to be expressed in the email responses, the intention of expressing them in the email (i.e., speech act), and the manipulated business data. Our work differs from existing works in two fields: (1) In the field of process prediction, we consider non-structured textual data (i.e., emails) for predicting the next activities, and (2) In the field of email recommendation, we inject BP knowledge of incoming emails to provide BP-oriented suggestions.
